 <h2>Introduction </h2>
 <div >When people hear the term hacking, they often think of someone infecting their computer
 with a virus, crashing a network and stealing money, or holding a company hostage from their daily
 operations with ransomware. Most people do not know that ethical hackers are people who are hired to
 think like a hacker or bad actor. They meticulously probe a company's systems to find any weaknesses
 and bring them to the attention of the business before the bad actors exploit them. Ethical hacking is an investment that companies
 in the modern world can't afford to do without.

 <h1>What is the <strong><i> Ethical hacking ? </strong></i> </h1>
 <p> An ethical hacker, also referred to as a white hat hacker, is an information security expert who systematically attempts to penetrate a computer system, network, application or other computing resource on behalf of its owners -- and with their permission -- to find security vulnerabilities that a malicious hacker could potentially exploit.
The purpose of ethical hacking is to evaluate the security of and identify vulnerabilities in systems, networks or system infrastructure. It includes finding and attempting to exploit any vulnerabilities to determine whether unauthorized access or other malicious activities are possible.
</p>
 <h1>Types of <strong><i> Ethical hacker:</strong></i></h1>
 <p> It is no big secret that any system, process, website, device, etc., can be hacked. In
 order to understand how the hack might happen and what the damage could be, ethical hackers must know how to think like malicious
 hackers and know the tools and techniques they are likely to use.</p>

 <h1> Why is <strong><i> Ethical hacking important?</strong></i></h1>
 <p class= >There is no doubt that information is the most valuable asset in today’s business environment. From government agencies to private companies, all kinds and sizes of organizations deal with massive amounts of sensitive and valuable data on a daily basis. As a result, they are often targeted by terrorist groups, hacker teams, cyber criminals and such.
In order to be safe and protected, organisations of all sizes take numerous security measures but simply locking your doors and shutting your windows can’t ensure your safety. In today’s world, organizations need to take proactive measures and update their security on a regular basis. Every day, hackers find new methods to penetrate through the barriers of firewalls, antivirus software and such, so your organization needs to keep up.
Ethical hackers, or white hat hackers, offer a new approach to safety. In order to test your security measures, they perform ‘pen tests’ on your organisation. In other words, they ‘hack’ your systems for you and provide you with insight and valuable information regarding your organization’s security posture. As a result, you catch the opportunity to see your organization from the perspective of a hacker without facing actual threats like sensitive data theft.
When you know how hackers see and approach your organization, you can update your security measures accordingly. Thus, you can make sure that the walls around your organization are thick and protective enough.
